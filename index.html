                        Pop. 1280 tells the story based in the 50s and is about a civil guard who makes his route through the towns of northern Spain. In constant communication with his fellow barracks via radio, he runs
                        into several bloody crimes and a plot in which nothing is what it seems.

                        <br />
                        We work the narrative based on the "unreliable narrator" or unreliable narrator. What the player perceives and what the protagonist perceives follow different aspects,
                        we seek a disconnection between player and protagonist, since the reasons for this fictional character are different from those expressed to the player and little by little he will carry out actions
                        based on your own intentions. We take the player through an experience where it is discovered that the protagonist is the author of a whole plan that revolves around his own benefit.

                        <br />
                        Purely physical interactions with the environment, 100% diegetic elements (no virtual interface, no minimap, story told by voice, etc.)
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Gameplay worked through exploration and puzzles, a bicycle that serves as transport and inventory, a diary where collect photographs and clues, etc.

                        Treated with a mild narrative in which a SWAT agent has the objective of finding his lost platoon. After advancing through a completely devastated town and fighting an infinity of undead,
                        find the origin of evil, a kind of necromancer sorceress that has killed your men and uses them against you in a final battle.

                        Use of lighting to create tension: shadows, streetlights that turn on and off, attraction to continuity with light bulbs, and the use of the character's flashlight that provides visibility in the pointing direction.

                        <br />
                        Using three types of weapons (submachine gun, shotgun and rifle) and escape tools (attractor grenades, dash and melee colpe), you must fight your way through waves of
                        all kinds of enemies throughout the town, until you reach the final boss.

                        Final Boss designed with attack phases in which he generates platforms of rot that obstruct the way, launches spheres of energy that damage you and summons your zombie squad as he enters a
